## 📖 About the Project

While mastering **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**, I built this landing page to deconstruct and recreate the premium "Apple-style" user experience. Rather than a simple visual clone, this project is a deep dive into modern animation systems and how they integrate with 3D environments.

### Key Objectives:

- **Scroll-Driven Storytelling:** Implementing complex timelines that progress based on user scroll position.
- **3D Integration:** Merging high-fidelity 3D models into a standard web layout.
- **Performance Optimization:** Managing assets and state effectively within a React ecosystem.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive 3D MacBook:** A fully rendered model using React Three Fiber.
- **Video-Texture Rendering:** Dynamic video content mapped directly onto the 3D model screen.
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger:** Multi-stage animation sequences that reveal content as you explore.
- **Smooth Easing:** Meticulously tuned motion curves for that "premium" feel.
- **Fully Responsive:** Optimized layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React + Vite
- **Animation:** GSAP (ScrollTrigger & Timelines)
- **3D Engine:** Three.js / React Three Fiber
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Coordinating complex **GSAP Timelines** with React’s component lifecycle.
